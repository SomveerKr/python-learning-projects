# Tinder Bot (Day 50)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Project Status Update**
>
> This project is **not done yet**. It will be built in a few days once I am able to create a new Facebook account, which is currently required for the bot to function but restricted by Facebook at the moment.

## Overview
This project is intended to be an automated bot for Tinder using Selenium. It is part of Day 50 of the Python learning journey.

## Current State
- Basic Selenium setup is present in `main.py`.
- Waiting on Facebook account creation permissions to proceed with login automation.
