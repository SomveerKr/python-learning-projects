# Python Learning Projects 🐍

Welcome to my Python learning journey! This repository contains all the projects I've built while following the **100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp** course by Angela Yu.

## 🎯 Learning Methodology

**Important Note**: I follow a unique learning approach where I:

1. **First, I build the projects** - I read the project requirements and attempt to build them independently
2. **Then, I watch the video solutions** - After completing my version, I watch Angela's video to understand different approaches and best practices
3. **Finally, I compare and learn** - I analyze the differences between my implementation and the course solution to deepen my understanding

This methodology helps me:

- Develop problem-solving skills independently
- Learn from mistakes and different approaches
- Build confidence in my coding abilities
- Understand multiple ways to solve the same problem
