# Python Learning Projects 🐍

Welcome to my Python learning journey! This repository contains all the projects I've built while following the **100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp** course by Angela Yu.

## 🎯 Learning Methodology

**Important Note**: I follow a unique learning approach where I:

1. **First, I build the projects** - I read the project requirements and attempt to build them independently
2. **Then, I watch the video solutions** - After completing my version, I watch Angela's video to understand different approaches and best practices
3. **Finally, I compare and learn** - I analyze the differences between my implementation and the course solution to deepen my understanding

This methodology helps me:

- Develop problem-solving skills independently
- Learn from mistakes and different approaches
- Build confidence in my coding abilities
- Understand multiple ways to solve the same problem

## 🚀 Projects in This Repository

### Day 7: Hangman Game 🎮

**Location**: `hangman-game/`

A classic word guessing game with ASCII art visualization. Players have 6 lives to guess a hidden word by suggesting letters. Features visual feedback with ASCII art and a large word database.

### Day 8: Caesar Cipher 🔐

**Location**: `ceaser-cipher/`

A Python implementation of the classic Caesar Cipher encryption and decryption algorithm. Features an interactive command-line interface, custom shift values, character preservation, and ASCII art. Demonstrates fundamental cryptography concepts.

### Day 10: Blackjack Card Game 🃏

**Location**: `blackjack-card-game/`

A command-line implementation of the classic Blackjack card game where you play against the computer dealer. Features ASCII art, realistic Blackjack rules, score tracking, and replay functionality. This was a capstone project demonstrating comprehensive Python programming skills.

### Day 15: Coffee Machine ☕

**Location**: `coffee-maker-v1/`

A Python-based coffee machine simulator with multiple coffee types, coin payment system, and resource management. Features espresso, latte, and cappuccino options with realistic pricing, automatic change calculation, and resource tracking. Demonstrates object-oriented programming concepts and data structure management.

### Day 16: Coffee Machine v2 (OOP) ☕

**Location**: `coffee-maker-v2/`

An enhanced coffee machine simulator built using Object-Oriented Programming principles. Features modular design with separate classes for CoffeeMaker, Menu, and MoneyMachine. Demonstrates class design, encapsulation, object interaction, and proper separation of concerns in a real-world application.

### Day 17: Quiz Game 🧠

**Location**: `quiz-game/`

A command-line quiz application with True/False questions and real-time score tracking. Features modular OOP design with separate classes for Question, QuizBrain, and data management. Demonstrates class implementation, data structures, user input handling, and interactive game logic.

### Day 20: Snake Game 🐍

**Location**: `snake-game-v1/`

A classic Snake game implementation using Python's Turtle graphics library. Features smooth movement, directional control with arrow keys, collision prevention, and responsive controls. Demonstrates object-oriented programming, game loop implementation, event handling, and graphics programming concepts.
