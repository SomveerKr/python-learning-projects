# Computation with NumPy and N-Dimensional Arrays

This project focuses on learning numerical computing using NumPy, a powerful library for Python. It covers the basics of creating and manipulating N-dimensional arrays (tensors) and applying these concepts to practical tasks like image processing.

## Project Overview

The project is structured as a Jupyter Notebook that guides you through:
- **Navigating NumPy Documentation**: Learning how to use the official documentation to find functions.
- **Creating Arrays**: Working with 1-D (vectors), 2-D (matrices), and N-D arrays (tensors).
- **Array Generation**: Using `arange`, `random`, and `linspace` to generate data.
- **Array Manipulation**: Slicing, broadcasting, and manipulating array shapes.
- **Image Processing**: Using NumPy to represent images as underlying data structures (ndarrays) and manipulating them (e.g., turning images into black and white, cropping, etc.).

## Files

- `Computation_with_NumPy_and_N_Dimensional_Array.ipynb`: The main Jupyter Notebook containing lessons and challenges.
- `yummy_macarons.jpg`: An image file used for image manipulation exercises.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following libraries installed:
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `scipy`
- `Pillow` (PIL)

You can install them using pip:
```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib scipy Pillow
```

## Usage

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Computation_with_NumPy_and_N_Dimensional_Array.ipynb
   ```
2. Follow the instructions in the notebook to complete the challenges and learn about NumPy.
