          Welcome to the Codeveer Log. I am a lawyer by graduation who traded case files for code editors. While my background is rooted in the Indian legal system, my passion lies in building technology that can solve its complexities.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am currently bridging the gap between law and software, evolving into a Full Stack Developer and Legal Engineer. My primary focus is Python—specifically automation and web development. I believe the future of law lies in efficient, scalable software solutions, and I’m on a mission to build tools that address the legal problems of India.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here, you’ll find my experiments with Flask, Next.js, and Selenium, along with my insights on where logic meets the law.
